## Resume

Hello readers! As of spring 2021, I am actively seeking a software engineering role, in the Denver metro or fully remote. The bulk of my recent experience in Full Stack Javascript, however I'm excited to expand my skillset to other languages, particularly for a role involving music and audio coding that might require low-level optimization. If anyone you know is seeking a motivated developer with clear communication skills and a commitment to learning, I would greatly appreciate any introduction or connection you can provide. 

Please check out my resume on Google Docs below, and if you find errors or have suggestions this is a living document and I'd appreciate any and all feedback. Thanks!

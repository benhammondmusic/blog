 [Play React-Tac-Toe](https://react-tac-toe.netlify.app/) 

My classmate [Armando](https://hashnode.com/@axhimanki) from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive-remote-flex) told us of someone he knew that had applied for a software engineering role at a larger company. Their tech interview consisted of the interviewers saying "ok, build us tic tac toe in a few hours; we'll come back and walk through your code". I heard this and was curious... could I do it in a few hours? Probably. Could I do it in React, a framework we had just barely started learning in my bootcamp (when should I use props? How does state work?) I dunno, but I could try!

The piece of the equation missing from my calculation were my `two-under-two` babies whom I'm solely responsible for workdays. I intermittently coded between diaper changes, bottle feedings, trains playing, building-and-then-destroying magnet block castles, and of course setting up a healthy dose of babysitting from "Cocomelon".

Did I finish in a few hours? Nope! Did I manage to get it working the next day, when I had my buddy coming over to help babysit?  [Heck ya!](https://react-tac-toe.netlify.app/) Even more rewarding, I was able to revisit the game a few weeks later after more fully covering React basics, and implemented functional components with hooks like `useEffect()` and `useState()`. These helped to fix up the win- and tie-condition timing issues, and for a bit of whimsy I ultimately decided to style the entire board like the default create-react-app logo, so the game actually spins in aqua blue as you play. Not only did I think it was funny and looked kinda cool; in all honesty I think it brings a level of drama to the gameplay I haven't experienced in tic-tac-toe since I was 7 years old.

I hope you enjoy playing  [this over-coded game in a slightly new way](https://react-tac-toe.netlify.app) , and I'd love to hear your thoughts! What should I build next? What's better than "Cocomelon" for a 2 year old to watch?

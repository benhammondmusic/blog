My classmate [Armando](https://hashnode.com/@axhimanki) from [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive-remote-flex)told us of someone he knew that had applied for a software engineering role at a larger company. The tech interview consisted of the interviewers saying "ok, build us tic tac toe in a few hours; we'll come back and walk through your code". I heard this and was curious... could I do it in a few hours? Probably. Could I do it in React, a framework we had just barely started learning in my bootcamp? I dunno, but I could try!

The piece of the equation missing from my calculation were my `two-under-two` babies whom I'm solely responsible for during workdays. I intermittently coded between diaper changes, bottle feedings, playing trains, building-and-then-destroying magnet block castles, and of course a healthy dose of babysitting from "Cocomelon".

Did I finish in a few hours? Nope! Did I manage to get it working by the next day, when I had my buddy coming over to help babysit?  [Heck ya!](https://react-tac-toe.netlify.app/)

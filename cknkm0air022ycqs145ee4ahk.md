## Django - Getting Started

_**This post was co-authored with fellow General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive member [JC Coles](https://jctech.blog/), following some custom suggestions from our instructor Adonis **_. Also, check out the entire ["Getting Started with Django" Series](https://blog.benhammond.tech/series/django)

If you've written full stack applications in JavaScript using Node, Express, perhaps Mongoose for accessing a database, maybe some packages like Passport to help manage user authentication and authorization, etc, you quickly find yourself repeating the same setup patterns over and over. The only differences come in when you accidentally misconfigure a setting or a route and spend hours debugging. Django aims to, if not _replace_ all of those steps, at least condense those disparate processes into one. 

The following step-by-step guide will assist a beginning Python developer in launching a Django project on their local development server (and then [deploying it to Heroku in the next blog post](https://blog.benhammond.tech/deploying-django-to-heroku)).

> If youâ€™re starting a brand new project, skip this section. Otherwise if you are downloading someone elseâ€™s project, run the following commands instead to properly configure it on your machine. This is the equivalent of running `npm i` when freshly cloning someone else's repo. When finished, continue at step "Creating a Home Page" below
1. `python3 -m venv .env`
2. `source .env/bin/activate`
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. `python3 manage.py runserver`
6. Visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser

> Having issues?
- if your project contains environmental variables, add them to an `.env` file inside your inner project folder (mine is `pedalcollector_project/.env`)
- try reseting your database (you'll lose anything you've added so be careful!) `DROPDB {{{your_database}}}` and `CREATEDB {{{your_database}}}`
- in settings.py, to run locally you'll need `DEBUG=True`; to deploy you'll have to change to `DEBUG=False`


# Django Environment Setup (New Project)

Python can and should be run in a virtual environment; this relates to the fact that your actual operating system utilizes Python code and by safely keeping your projects in a protected environment, you minimize the risk of accidentally misconfiguring your entire system. In short, you'll be simulating a mini-computer inside your computer, and running your Django project from there. You can quickly tell when your terminal is inside of the virtual environment by looking for the _(.env)_ at the beginning of your terminal prompt:

![command line prompt showing parentheses env](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618546676648/ES9RjRW8D.png)
 
## Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment
- `python3 -m venv .env`

Activate it
- `source .env/bin/activate`

## Database

Create a postgres database. _You'll need this exact name again soon, so write it in your project notes somewhere you'll remember._
- `createdb your-app-db` 

> `your-app-db` is the example I'll be using; you can use whatever you want throughout this post, just be consistent!

> If you have weird errors while testing things and somehow perhaps have corrupt data in your database, you can easily remove and re-add the database with the following commands in your terminal:
1. `dropdb your-app-db`
2. `createdb your-app-db`
3. `python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Dependencies 

Install Django and dependencies. Psycopg2 helps Python interact with your postgres DB (similar to how Mongoose allowed Node to easily interact with MongoDB)
- `pip3 install django-extensions`
- `pip3 install Django`
- `pip3 install psycopg2`
> if that didnâ€™t work run: `psycopg2-binary`. 
- `pip3 install python-decouple`
> please note there is a difference between _python_decouple_ and _decouple_, you need the former.

Record those settings: _requirements.text_ is the Django equivalent of your Node app's _package.json_, informing everyone what settings and packages must be configured to function.
- `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`


 
# Project Setup

Django _projects_ can contain multiple Django _apps_. 

## New Project

Create a new project
- `django-admin startproject your-app .` 

Make a git ignore file
- `touch .gitignore`

Specify the files and folders to ignore
- Open the blank `.gitignore` file in VSCode

> For a comprehensive `.gitignore` file like you might get from a create-react-app, you can visit [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io) and select _Django_. This will generate a complete file for you: [click to view Django .gitignore](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/django)

- Whether you build your gitignore or copy and paste from the site above, be sure it includes the following items:

```
# this hidden folder contains your local, virtual environment
.env

# this hidden file contains sensitive keys and environmental config vars 
your-app_project/.env
```


## Setting Up Environmental Variables

- open `settings.py`
- scroll down to the line that declares the `SECRET_KEY=`, and **cut** the entire line (CMD+x)
- open the newly created `your-app_project/.env` file (it should be currently empty)
- paste in the secret key from above, but be sure to remove the empty spaces around the `=` and remove all quotes from the value after the `=`. You could also use any random secret string you like
- add in `DEBUG=True` on a new line

Your .env file should end up looking like this:

```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY={{{your_secret_key}}}
# this is the database name you used at the beginning of this setup; I told you to write it down somewhere... did you? 
DATABASE_NAME=your-app-db
```

## Reading In Env Variables

Now, we want to make our app read these sensitive or configuration dependent variables, whether it is in production (e.g. deployed to Heroku) or development (working locally on your own computer). To read variables from the `.env` file you created and filled in the last step:

- open **settings.py**
- add `from decouple import config` at the top (right below the existing import)
- where you removed the `SECRET_KEY` line in **settings.py**, add back this line which will now read it dynamically (from your .env locally or your deployed config vars): `SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')`
- scroll to the line that says `DEBUG=True` and replace the line with `DEBUG=config('DEBUG')`
- below, replace the line with `ALLOWED_HOSTS` with `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['herokuapp.com','.localhost', '127.0.0.1', '[::1]']`
> If you will be deploying this somewhere else, replace Heroku with your actual app URL


## Main App

Create a second app within this project called **main_app**
- `python3 manage.py startapp main_app`

> If you're having issues, make sure:
- you included the ` .` at the end of the start project command
- you might need to use the command `python` instead of `python3`; this seemed to occur on newer Macs or machines where `python --version` and `python3 --version` both referenced the same release of Python. The error popping up was a `raise ImportError` with the message `couldn't import django no module found`
 
Let Django know about your 2nd app:
- Open the project in VSCode: `code .`
- Open your project settings: `your-app_project/settings.py`
- Scroll down to `Installed_Apps` and add `main_app,` as the new first element in the array. Remember the comma!
![Adding main_app screenshot](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1618548443970/aAONZQhrq.png)

## Development Server

Start up the development server on your local machine
- `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Open a browser and visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000] to see your site (well, just the fun rocket for now... ðŸš€)

## Development Database

Configure the project for postgres by changing the database entry in **settings.py**, and reading the database name as an environmental variable.
```
# new database info
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': config('DATABASE_NAME'),
    }
}
```

## Migrations

Stage the db migrations (kind of like git adding and committing, but for changes to the database schema as the app evolves over time
- `python3 manage.py makemigrations` (this probably won't do anything)
- `python3 manage.py migrate` (this should run through the models in the app like the built in users, and add this info to your database)

Restart your server (you can do this regularly while debugging)
- kill the process using `<CONTROL> + C`
- start it again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
 

# Creating a Home Page
 
## Add a `home` route

Routes are defined in the `urls.py` file(s); you _could_ add all of your routes to `your-app_project/urls.py`, but it is best practice for each Django app to define its own and include a link to the new URLs file in the project's URLconf:

- `touch main_app/urls.py`
- Open the newly created file in VSCode
- Set up the imports and basic route using the code below:

``` python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    # more routes will go here
]
```

> Using an empty string `""` as the first parameter in `path()` is telling Django to route the base URL with no added paths to the home view (e.g. `your-project.com/` Later we will add more routes, for example using `"about/"` as the first argument in the new route, and linking that to an `about` page, which the user will access by going to `your-project.com/about`

Now, include this new file in the existing projectâ€™s urls.py
- Open `your-app_project/urls.py`
- Add a new item to the `urlpatterns` array, making sure the items are separated by commas
- Also you will need to import the `include` function before calling it in the array
- It will end up looking like this:

``` python
from django.contrib import admin
# from django.urls import path
# add include to your imports from django.urls
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    # add this line below
    path('', include('main_app.urls')),
]
```

## Add a home view

Now that the home _route_ knows where to direct the client, you need to make a home _view_ as a connector between the current route and the correct template to render. Open up your **views.py** and add the following method:
```
def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html')
```

## Add a home template

Starting very simply, you'll create the `home.html` file
- `mkdir main_app/templates`
- `touch main_app/templates/home.html` 
- Open `home.html` in VSCode and paste in some valid HTML as a starting point:

> Tip: to save a step, in VSCode you could right click on **main_app** in the navigation bar, and select "New File", and then add the line `templates/home.html`. This will create the templates folder and also the html file in one command

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Home</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```



Back in your browser, visit [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) and refresh to view your sweet new home page. If it doesn't work, remember to restart your Django server:
- in terminal: `<CONTROL> + C`
- `python3 manage.py runserver`

# Done!

You should now have a functioning (very simple) Django app within your project, viewable on your local machine. To continue building, follow the next steps:
- Adding more routes, templates, and rendered data _(blog post currently being written)_
- Reading from your database _(blog post currently being written)_
- Deploying your Django app on Heroku _(blog post currently being written)_
